Create a simulation for a Mars Rover that can navigate a grid-based terrain. Your Rover should be able to move forward, turn left, and turn
right. You'll need to make sure that it avoids obstacles and stays within the boundaries of the grid. Remember to use pure Object-Oriented
Programming, design patterns, and avoid using if-else conditional constructs.
